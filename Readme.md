# Tesla Stock Forecasting Using LSTM

## About
This repository contains notebooks and datasets for a comprehensive project focused on forecasting Tesla (TSLA) stock prices. The predictive models employed include a single-step LSTM for immediate forecasting and a multi-stacked LSTM for extended predictions, spanning multiple days into the future (equivalent to a month in business days). The documentation not only presents the practical implementation but also provides an insightful exploration of the intuitive and mathematical underpinnings of LSTM networks.
